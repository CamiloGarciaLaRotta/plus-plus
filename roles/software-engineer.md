_What image comes to mind when you think "engineer"? Many people think software engineers just sit at their computer writing lines of code all day. However, this role has many different aspects to it and uses lots of skills!_

By definition, a software engineer uses Computer Science and Programming principles to develop software solutions, build digital products, database programs, and computer systems for businesses.

> "Most developers create applications with the user experience in mind. Behind the scenes, they have to juggle multiple software projects and consult with their coworkers on how things should be done instead of just coding the entire time." - Xavier, Software Engineer at Codeacademy

Engineers get to collaborate with other people, such as Designers, Data Scientists, and Project Managers.

### What does an Engineer do?

* Collaborate with other people, such as Designers, Data Scientists, and Project Managers - as you will learn in your teams, development is a group effort!
- Review others' code, do research, and meet with other teams to find the best solution and processes for whatever problem they are trying to solve or feature they are building.
- Develop a functional piece of software
- Run tests to see if there are existing bugs to remove
- Other related roles that have overlap with an Engineer are a Programmer and Web Developer. You may see these terms used a lot, later on in your career journey. Often, they are different names to describe the same role. For example, some companies call programmers web developers or front-end engineers, while others may call them software or UI (User Interface) engineers.
- Web developers are focused on building user-facing applications. Software engineers are more likely to work on computer systems as a whole.
- Did you know? Only 2% of employed engineers are Latinas. Development is a male-dominated field, which can be discouraging. We need more Latina and women engineers! Knowing about the lack of diversity in the tech world is all the more reason to keep pursuing your passion in coding, break these barriers, and believe in yourself!
