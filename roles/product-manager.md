Product Managers drive and lead their team's vision and are experts on the _why_ and _how_ of the product.
They clearly define the problem that the product is solving, and what outcomes and goals need to be reached in order for it to be created. They work closely with teams of designers, engineers, and sometimes researchers, analysts and marketers.

As the Venn Diagram shows, product managements lives at the intersection of Tech, User Experience and Business. The Product Manager must research and become acquainted with the needs of the user, the market, the customer, and the problem they have that you're trying to solve.

They work with lots of information such as client feedback, research reports, market trends, statistics â€“ all to help define the vision of the product and have a roadmap to build it successfully. Great Product Managers are detail-oriented but are also able to see the big picture and prioritize what features are most important when building the product.

## User Stories

A user story helps capture the user's voice and point of view. It helps define the _what_ of the product or feature. The typical template is as follows:

> As a [description of user],
> I want [functionality]
> so that [benefit/desired result].

This also involves defining the _Acceptance Criteria._ These are the measurable results of the product, what defines "done"? And how will you know when it is done?
