# Codespaces

We use [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) to make sure that everyone
has access to the tools and software that they need for this course
so that everyone can learn to code.

A [Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) is a development environment
that is created just for you. You can think of it like it is your own
computer. When you create a Codespace it also comes with a bunch of tools
and software already installed. So you can focus on writing code instead of
figuring out how to install git, Linux, Ruby, Node.js etc.

## [Creating your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace)

1. Open the [SparkleHub](https://github.com/codechica/SparkleHub) repo in a browser.
1. Launch a new codespace.
    1. Click on "Code"
    1. Click on "Codespaces"
    1. Click on "New codespace"
    1. Select "2 core"
    1. Click on "Create codespace"
    1. Click on "Open in VSCode"
    1. Accept the project extensions
    1. Be patient
1. Open a Terminal ("Terminal" -> "New Terminal")
1. Type `./script/server`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.

This is your copy of the final project that you are free to explore.
Take a look at the files in the directory [app/views](https://github.com/CodeChica/SparkleHub/blob/main/app/views/).

If you want to turn off the server press "Ctrl" + "c" in the terminal.

### [Deleting your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/deleting-a-codespace)

When you are finished with your Codespace it is a good idea to clean it up.

1. Open [Your codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) in a web browser.
1. Click on the `...` menu on the right side.
1. Choose the "Delete" option.
