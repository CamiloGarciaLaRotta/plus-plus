# Codespaces

We use [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) to make sure that everyone
has access to the tools and software that they need for this course
so that everyone can learn to code.

A [Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) is a development environment
that is created just for you. You can think of it like it is your own
computer. When you create a Codespace it also comes with a bunch of tools
and software already installed. So you can focus on writing code instead of
figuring out how to install git, Linux, Ruby, Node.js etc.

## [Creating your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace)

1. Open the [CodeChica++](https://github.com/CodeChica/SparkleHub) repo in a browser.
1. Launch a new codespace.
  1. Click on "Code"
  1. Select "Open with Codespaces"
  1. Select "New codespace"
  1. Select "2 cores Linux"
  1. Click on "Create codespace"
1. Open a Terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal)
  1. Look for the "Terminal" menu at the top.
  1. Click on "New Terminal"
1. Type `./script/server`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.

You now have your own copy of the final project that you are free to explore.

### [Deleting your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/deleting-a-codespace)

When you are finished with your Codespace it is a good idea to clean it up.

1. Open [Your codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) in a web browser.
1. Click on the `...` menu on the right side.
1. Choose the "Delete" option.
