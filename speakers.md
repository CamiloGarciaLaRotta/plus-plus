# Guest Speakers

Code Chica++ is our an advanced-level coding course where girls will learn development fundamentals and explore the roles of Engineer, Designer, and Product Manager through building features on an existing application. 

We're looking for guest speakers who work in *tech and development* to come and chat with our students about their experience and get them inspired to pursue a career in technology.
