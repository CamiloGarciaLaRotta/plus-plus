# Lesson 0x03

Part 1: Get an existing suite of tests passing.
Part 2: Start contributing tests that might be missing.
Part 3: Reproduce a bug as an automated test.
Part 4: Fix it
Part 5: Refactoring. Make it DRY, YAGNI and KISS(parkles). Gorilla/Banana.

Introduction to tests and pair programming. Break into pairs, work on a bug
fixing (make the tests pass), submit the changes as a pull request.
Provide example (SparkleHub) with problems to fix, work on the bug fix & share
how they fixed it. Get practice reviewing each others code and giving feedback.

Learn the error message. "What's wrong with this code" challenge.
  * Syntax, logic

How often will they be debugging?
How will this differentiate them from other devs?
