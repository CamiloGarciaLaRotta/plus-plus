* Git + GitHub fundamentals, writing commits, messages, pull requests, forking,
  get familiar with how to save their code & collaborate on that platform.
    * memorization game (flash card / jeopardy) to learn new coding terms.
      * forking
      * pull request
      * repo
      * merging
      * checkout
      * push and pull
      * branching
      * clone
      * add
      * commit
    * intro to the concept of pull requests and collaborating on code
    * branching - exercise could be a story "once upon a time in a land far far
      away..." and could add sentences.
* Positive Sandwhich! Rule for giving feedback on code.
  * Start with something positive, layer in constructive criticism, end with
    something positive.
* Create GitHub account. Add the Latinitas org badge to their profile.
  * Add README's - first repo on their page. Can personalize, add their bio,
    icebreakers, favorite emojis/ what they wanna do in the future.
  * Example of ReadME repo https://github.com/Apang20
* Rinse & repeat exercises (source control, do an exercise each class?)
