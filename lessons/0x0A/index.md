# Final Project

In groups, you will create 1-3 new features for [SparkleHub][sparklehub].

Each group will choose who will be the [Product Manager][product-manager],
[Designer][designer], and [Engineer][engineer]. You will have an opportunity to
rotate roles each class. You will work together to try out each of these roles
and help each other improve.

Group Roles:

- Product Manager: comes up with new feature
- Designer: comes up with a wireframe of that feature
- Engineer: fixes bugs, implements feature

Your team will submit:

1. A [User Story][user-story] submitted as a [new issue][issue].
1. A [Wireframe][wireframe] of the feature submitted as an attachment in the issue.
1. A [Task breakdown][tasks] for how to build the feature included in the issue.
1. A [Pull Request][pull-request] with working code submitted to the [SparkleHub][sparklehub] repo.

Below is a video of a fictitious meeting between a Customer,
Product Manager, Designer and an Engineer to help you come up with some ideas.
