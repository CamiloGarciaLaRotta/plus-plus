## Lesson 0x05

Warm up:

* Girls go into groups, they have to do mini coding challenge

Engineer's guide to building things.
Split class into teams (3-4 people per team) give them the project requirements
and it's up to them to split up roles and wear different hats.

Girls share with each other their feature idea and wireframes.

They choose 1-3 features to move forward with. Girls have to have at least one
feature, if they'd like to include more, they have to prioritize which is most
valuable.

Final project requirements:
* In groups, you will create 1-3 new features on SparkleHub. For each feature
  provide:
    * Product Manager Guide
      * Definition of the feature
      * What is the issue you are solving?
      * How will you know that the feature is done?
    * Wireframe of the feature(s)
    * Working software
* Group roles: (will switch each class)
  * Product Manager: come up with new feature.
  * Designer: come up with a wireframe of that feature.
  * Engineer: fix this one bug, implement incomplete feature.

Outcomes:

* Overview of engineer's role in product development.
* Girls will get into teams.
* They will chose their roles/groups, if they can't choose, the instructor
  assigns each of them a role. Each class they will switch and rotate roles.
