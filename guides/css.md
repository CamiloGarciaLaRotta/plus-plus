### CSS

CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language that is used to tell
the browser how to make your page look.

In CSS you specify which types of elements should get certain settings.

e.g.

```css
/* Find all 'div' elements and give them a pink background. */
div {
  background-color: pink;
}

/* Find all elements with a `hero` class and center their text. */
.hero {
  text-align: center;
}

/*
  Find the one element with an id of `container`
  and give it a width of 90% of the screen then make sure
  the left and right margins are even so that the content
  is centered.
*/
#container {
  width: 90%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```
