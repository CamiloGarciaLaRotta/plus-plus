### JavaScript

JavaScript is a language that allows you to write code that can react to events
in the browser. When you *click* on a button, this raises an event that can be
handled by JavaScript code. JavaScript can then be used to manipulate the
Document Object Model (a.k.a. DOM) to perform actions like making a network
request to a server or validate data entered on a page.

e.g.

The code below will render an alert box with the text "Ouch!" when you click
on a page.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) {
  var bodyElement = document.querySelector('body');

  bodyElement.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    // This is a great way to irritate visitors to your website.
    alert('Ouch!');
  })
});
```
