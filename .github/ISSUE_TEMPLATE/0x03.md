## Introduction

In this lesson we will introduce testing and pair programming. We will continue to work collaboratively by submitting pull requests and reviewing each other's code. We will also learn the value of writing clean, readable code.

By the end of this lesson:

* you will get an existing suite of test passing.
* you will write your first test.
* you will reproduce and fix your first bug.
* you will review code and give feedback.
* you will refactor your code.

### Why Test Driven Development (TDD)?

Test driven development is the process of writing tests before actually coding anything. This helps a developer think about the requirements of a feature they're working on before writing the code for it. You can be more sure that you haven't missed anything important about a feature's needs when you use this process. 

Test driven development also makes refactoring much easier because we don't have to worry about breaking any existing code. If we make changes, and something does change, a test will fail (essentially warning us), and we can make sure everything works again before pushing changes to the main branch of our project. TDD also helps with better code coverage, which leads to fewer bugs in your application. Finally, you can look back on your code and know exactly what you were trying to do by reading your tests.

### Get an existing suite of tests to pass

* [ ] Open up codespaces
* [ ] In your terminal, run `bin/rails test`
* [ ] One at a time, get each test to pass. Use the following steps to problem solve if you get stuck:
  1. Understand the error
  2. Research a solution
  3. Ask a peer for help
  4. Ask an instructor

### Write your first test

When we write tests, we follow the steps of "Red, Green, Refactor". What this means is, we first write a test for a feature we want to build. That feature has not been written yet, so our test will fail at first (red). We write the simplest code to get our test to pass (green), and finally refactor to make our code better.



### Peer Review

* [ ] In your terminal, type `git checkout -b branch-name`. You can use your name with `branch-name`, i.e. `kirsty-brewster`.
* [ ] Type `git add .`. The `.` means "all" files in this directory.
* [ ] Type `git status` to make sure all your changes were added. You should see everything in green.
* [ ] Type `git commit -m "Short message about changes made."`. Replace the example message with your own.
* [ ] Finally, type `git push`.

As a group, everyone will review each others code. You will be able to see a message that says "(Student name) made changes to this repository."
 * [ ] Click the green button to review the changes.
 * [ ] When giving feedback, use the "critique sandwich" method.
  1. Say something positive about your partner's code.
  2. Give your critiques. What could be better? What do you have questions about?
  3. End with another positive!
 * [ ] Once you're done, click "submit for review."

### Refactor

When you receive notes from your teammates, now is when you can look at how to improve your code. Keep these things in mind when refactoring:
1. Does your code do what it should do well?
2. Functions should be responsible for one thing in general. This is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Do you have any functions that are long and can be broken up in this way?
3. Keep it DRY. DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". Do you see any code that repeats and could be put into it's own function to simplify your code? If so, go ahead and do that!
4. Keep methods small. Create chunks of code that you can reuse in different places.

None of these are hard and fast rules, so use your best judgement. Ultimately, we should care about "readability". Will you be able to make sense of your code when you come back to it later? Will others be able to understand your code and what it's doing?

### Rinse and repeat

Repeat the peer review and refactor steps until you are happy with the state of your code. Then, start from Step 1 again, and write more tests!

## Discussion

Please add a comment to this issue to answer the following questions:

1. Why are tests important?
2. Name some strategies for writing clean code.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned about test driven development and the reasons for its use. You also learned some intro Ruby concepts in order to get your first suite of tests to pass and to write your own tests. Finally, you practiced peer reviewing someone else's code, and refactoring to make your code better.
