## Introduction

In this lesson we will introduce testing and pair programming. We will continue to work collaboratively by submitting pull requests and reviewing each other's code. We will also learn the value of writing clean, readable code.

By the end of this lesson you will:

* write code to fix an existing suite of tests.
* review code and give feedback.
* refactor your code.

Read the [lesson guide](https://codechica.ca/lessons/0x03/) for help.

### Get an existing suite of tests to pass

* [ ] Open up your [codespaces](https://codechica.ca/guides/github.html#codespaces) for the [plus-plus](https://github.com/CodeChica/plus-plus) repo.
* [ ] Complete each step in https://github.com/CodeChica/plus-plus/tree/main/labs/ruby#lab-ruby

### Peer Review

Once you have submitted your pull request. Find someone to review and approve
the pull request.

* [ ] Submit your pull request for review.
* [ ] Review a pull request. Use the "critique sandwich" method to give feedback.

## Discussion

Please add a comment to this issue to answer the following questions:

1. What are some Ruby data types?
2. What is an object in Ruby?
3. Why are tests important?
4. What is "Red, Green, Refactor"?
5. What is "Arrange, Act, Assert"?
6. Name some strategies for writing clean code.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned about test driven development and the reasons for its use. You also learned some intro Ruby concepts in order to get your first suite of tests to pass and to write your own tests. Finally, you practiced peer reviewing someone else's code, and refactoring to make your code better.
