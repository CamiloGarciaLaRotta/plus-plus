## Introduction

In this lesson we will review HTML, CSS and JavaScript then we will dive into the world of source control.
By the end of this lesson:

* you will have a GitHub account.
* you will have a website hosted on GitHub.
* you will understand how to backup your code with git.

### Getting Started

* [ ] [Register](https://github.com/signup) for a GitHub account.
* [ ] Work through the [Introduction to HTML](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html) lab.

### Customize your profile

* [ ] [Read Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* [ ] Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [ ] [Add a profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme#adding-a-profile-readme)

### Launch the SparkleHub codespace

In this section you're going to run the final project in a your own [Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces).
[Try the troubleshooting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/codespaces-reference/troubleshooting-your-codespace)
or [open a new question](https://github.com/CodeChica/plus-plus/discussions/categories/q-a) if you get stuck.

* [ ] Open the [CodeChica++](https://github.com/codechica/plus-plus) repo in a browser.
* [ ] Launch a new codespace.
  * Click on "Code"
  * Select "Open with Codespaces"
  * Select "New codespace"
  * Select "2 cores Linux"
  * Click on "Create codespace"
* [ ] Open a Terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal)
* [ ] Type `./script/setup`
* [ ] Type `./script/server`
* [ ] Open the app in your browser.

You now have your own copy of the final project that you are free to explore.
Take a look at the files in the directory [app/views](https://github.com/CodeChica/plus-plus/blob/main/app/views/).

The final project is written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
To learn more consider going through the following guides:

* [ ] [Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
* [ ] [Layouts and Rendering](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)

### Cleanup

When you are finished making code changes to your copy of the project it is
good to clean up any Codespaces that you created.

* [ ] Open [Your codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
* [ ] Delete the codespace

## Discussion

Please add a comment to this issue to answer the following questions:

1. What is HTML?
1. What is CSS?
1. What is JavaScript?
1. What's a version control system?
1. What is `git`?
1. Why do developers use git?

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you reviewed HTML,CSS and JavaScript. You started to use a tool
called `git` to save your code and you created a free GitHub account to save
your code. You updated the profile page one your GitHub account to showcase
your coding skills.

You also had a chance to run the [`SparkleHub`](https://github.com/CodeChica/plus-plus)
application to get familiar with the app that you will be working on for your final project.
