## Introduction

In this lesson you will learn how to use [`git`][git] to save your code.
Also, you will learn how to use GitHub to create a backup of your code in the
cloud.

By the end of this lesson you will:

* Learn to use a terminal a.k.a Command Line.
* Learn to use `git` to save your code.
* Create your own blog/website.

For this lesson you will need to [open your Codespace][codespace] and then
launch VSCode and [open a Terminal][integrated_terminal].

### Hello Terminal

Follow the instructions in [Terminal Guide][terminal_guide] to get familiar
with the Terminal. Once you finish the exercises over there come back here to
answer the following questions.

Add a comment to explain what happens when you execute the following commands
in the terminal. Include a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal in
the comment section below.

* [ ] `pwd`
* [ ] `ls`
* [ ] `cd .`
* [ ] `man ls`

### Git - Terminal

When you finish working through the [git Guide][git_guide] come back here to
complete the following exercise.

In the following exercise you will initialize a new git repository, add a
project README file and save it in git.

Complete the following steps in your Codespace.

* [ ] Create a new directory. `mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/myusername/hello-world`
* [ ] Change directories. `cd ~/src/github.com/myusername/hello-world`
* [ ] Print the working directory. `pwd`
* [ ] Initialize an empty git repository. `git init`
* [ ] Create an empty README file. `touch README.md`
* [ ] Add a heading to the README. `echo '# Hello World' >> README.md`
* [ ] Check the status of the files tracked by git. `git status`
* [ ] Add the README file to git. `git add README.md`
* [ ] Commit the new file with a friendly message. `git commit -am 'Add a README'`
* [ ] Check the status of the files tracked by git. `git status`
* [ ] View the history of changes in the git repository. `git log` (note: press `q` to exit)

### Git - VSCode, Source Control Manager (SCM)

In this section, you will learn how to interact with `git` from within Visual Studio Code.

* [ ] Open VSCode in a new workspace. e.g. ~/src/github.com/myusername/goodbye-world
* [ ] Create a new file named "README.md" (File -> New File)
* [ ] Add content to the README.md
* [ ] Open the SCM section in the side bar.
* [ ] Stage the README.md file by clicking the "+" sign.
* [ ] Commit the change by clicking on the ellipsis in the side bar and choose "Commit -> Commit"
* [ ] Add a commit message and press Enter.

### GitHub

* [ ] Open a browser and navigate to https://github.com/new
* [ ] Create a new repo named "hello-world" scoped to your username
* [ ] Follow the instructions to push the repo created in the previous step up to GitHub.

### Blog

In this section, you will create a blog hosted on GitHub.

* [ ] [Create a blog using GitHub Pages][gh_pages]

## Discussion

Please add a comment to this issue to answer the following questions:

1. What is a terminal?
1. How do you change directories?
1. How do you list the files in a directory?
1. How do you initialize a new `git` repo?
1. How do you add a new file to `git`?

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you have learned to use a terminal to create a new git repo,
add files to git, and to publish those files to GitHub. You also learned
to use your coding skills to publish a blog/website.
