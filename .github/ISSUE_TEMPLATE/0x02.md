## Introduction

In this lesson you will learn how to use [`git`][git] to save your code.
Also, you will learn how to use GitHub to create a backup of your code in the
cloud.

By the end of this lesson you will:

* Learn to use a terminal a.k.a Command Line.
* Learn to use `git` to save your code.

### Hello Terminal

What happens when you execute the following commands in the terminal?

* [ ] `pwd`
* [ ] `ls`
* [ ] `cd .`
* [ ] `man ls`

### Git - Terminal

In the following exercise you will initialize a new git repository, add a
project README file and save it in git.

* [ ] Create a new directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/myusername/hello-world
    ```
* [ ] Change directories.
    ```bash
    cd ~/src/github.com/myusername/hello-world
    ```
* [ ] Print the working directory.
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
* [ ] Initialize an empty git repository.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
* [ ] Create an empty README file.
    ```bash
    touch README.md
    ```
* [ ] Add a heading to the README.
    ```bash
    echo '# Hello World' >> README.md
    ```
* [ ] Check the status of the files tracked by git.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
* [ ] Add the README file to git.
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
* [ ] Commit the new file with a friendly message.
    ```bash
    git commit -am 'Add a README'
    ```
* [ ] Check the status of the files tracked by git. 
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
* [ ] View the history of changes in the git repository.
    ```bash
    git log
    ```

### GitHub

* [ ] Open a browser and navigate to https://github.com/new
* [ ] Create a new repo named "hello-world" scoped to your username
* [ ] Follow the instructions to push the repo created in the previous step up to GitHub.
